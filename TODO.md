## TODO

- [ ] Simplify buffers
- [ ] Add relaxation
- [ ] General clean-up of the code
- [x] Better plotting/visualization
- [x] Remove `x` from element functions (only needed for nonstructured grids)
- [x] Fix PGD Ψ to save in gauss points
- [ ] Calculate Ψ in displacement function instead (for FEM and ~~PGD~~ )
- [x] Pretty printing of status and residuals etc
- [ ] Write a more efficient solver integrating both g and K at the same time
- [ ] Remove `kefunc` from all global residuals
- [ ] Simplify boundary conditions for FEM
- [ ] Fix mtrl params for FEM
